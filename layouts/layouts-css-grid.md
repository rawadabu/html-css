# Layouts: Floats, Flexbox, and CSS Grid Fundamentals

## Layout = THE DESIGN

- Layout is the way text, images and other content placed and arranged on a webpage.
- Layout gives the page visual structure, into which we place our content.
- Building a layout: arranging page elements into a visual structure, instead of simply having them placed one after another(normal flow).

The 3 ways of building layouts with CSS

1. Float Layouts: The old way of building layouts of all sizes, using the float CSS property.
2. Flexbox: Modern way of laying out elements in a 1-dimensional row without using floats. Perfect for component layouts.
3. CSS Grid: For laying out element in a fully-fledged 2-dimensional grid. Perfect for page layouts and complex components.
